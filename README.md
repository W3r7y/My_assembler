#About The Project

---
The program simulates an assembler, which translates code written in Assembly to binary code.
 The program accepts a list of text files, processes the instructions they contain, verifies there is no syntax errors,
 and outputs the files containing the translated program to machine language. If any syntax error is found, the program 
will output an informative error message for the user.
